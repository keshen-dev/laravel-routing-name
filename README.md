# laravel routing name 
In Laravel, a route name is a unique identifier for a specific route. It can be used to generate URLs, redirect to routes, and more. To assign a name to a route in Laravel, you can use the name method:

```
Route::get('/user/profile', function () {
    //
})->name('profile');
```
In this example, we have assigned the name "profile" to the route. To generate a URL for this route, we can use the route function and pass in the name:

```
$url = route('profile');
```

This will generate a URL that corresponds to the "profile" route. We can also use the name to redirect to the route:

```
return redirect()->route('profile');
```

This will redirect to the "profile" route. It's important to use route names instead of hardcoding URLs in your code, as it makes your code more maintainable and allows you to easily change the URL in the future if needed.
